*Markdown* is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.
*Markdown*is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

**GitHub.com** uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features,
many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

**markdown**can be used in many places in Github:
1. Gists
2. Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
3. Files with the .md or .markdown extension
