In my case I had curly braces where it should have been parentheses.

const Button = () => {
    <button>Hello world</button>
}
Where it should have been:

const Button = () => (
    <button>Hello world</button>
)
The reason for this, as explained in the MDN Docs is that an arrow function wrapped by () will return the value it wraps, so if I wanted to use curly braces I had to add the return keyword, like so:

const Button = () => {
    return <button>Hello world</button>
}
