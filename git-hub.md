 #Version Control
: is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by 
recording changes By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

 **Git** is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a 
reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
  
 Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

1. Committed
Data is securely stored in a local database
2. Modified
File has been changed but not committed to the database
3. Staged
Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

**GitHub** is a hub-focused tool which facilitates Integration-Manager Workflow. It is the largest 
existing host for Git repositories and isused by millions of developers worldwide. A high percentage of Git repositories reside 
on GitHub, and this resource is used by many open source projects.
